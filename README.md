# Competitive Programming Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for competitive programming problems. This collection represents my journey through the challenging and exhilarating world of competitive programming (CP). What began as a casual exploration has evolved into a deep engagement with the CP community and problem-solving strategies.

## About This Repository

When I embarked on this adventure, I did not anticipate how captivated I would become. As a result, you'll notice that most of the programs initially have names and comments in Polish. While this might seem messy at first glance, I've taken care to categorize all my solutions to facilitate easy navigation and discovery. My hope is that this repository will not only document my progress but also serve as a valuable resource for others embarking on their own competitive programming journeys.

## Organization

The solutions in this repository are organized to help you quickly find what you need:

- **By Topic**: If you're focusing on specific areas of computer science or mathematics, you can find problems categorized by topic.
- **By Contest**: Solutions are also organized by the contests they were part of, providing context and allowing for targeted practice.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions for learning or inspiration. Many solution is accompanied by comments that explain the thought process and strategies employed.

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as a personal record of my competitive programming journey, I welcome contributions in the form of:

- **Suggestions**: If you have ideas on how to improve a solution or enhance the repository's organization, please feel free to share.
- **Corrections**: Spotted an error? Let me know! I'm always looking to improve my solutions.
